## Note

- I am in no way involved in hosting, endorsing, or distributing illegal content
- I do not own or manage the servers used to host files, do not ask for updates or content
- I do not plan on making updates or patches even if it stops working
- Based on AndroidSideloader/Rookie : https://github.com/nerdunit/androidsideloader, https://github.com/VRPirates/rookie
- If the app stops working, check https://wiki.vrpirates.club/downloads/vrp-public.json, URL or password might have changed (password is b64 encoded and needs to be decoded), you just need to update values in the appsettings.json
